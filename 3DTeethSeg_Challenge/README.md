# Goal
Use Dataset from https://github.com/abenhamadou/3DTeethSeg_MICCAI_Challenges located at https://osf.io/xctdy/overview 

and segment and evaluate with https://github.com/huiminxiong/TSegFormer/

Notes:
- Using 2/6 zip files to keep eval testing small
- Initially not planning on training on dataset
- Datasets saved locally at ~/Documents/Data/3DTeethSeg_Challenge/*
- Split files will need to be analyzed to confirm we have the right data.
- The 3DTeethSeg_MICCAI_Challenges repo has the evaluation script.
